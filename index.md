## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

* Lab 5, part 2

    This is one of my favorites as I always wanted to know how converting numbers worked. I was able to convert any decimal number into a more detailed format, inches and eighths of an inch. It also made me more comfortable in writing functions. 
* Lab 6, part 2

    This is my second favorite as it was centered around the game blackjack. While I didn't have any knowledge of blackjack intially, this lab really helped me understand it and I even found it to be fun. In this lab we created many functions using logical operators for the first time to calculate the correct value of a Blackjack regardless of how many aces were dealt.
* Lab 9, part 1

    This is my all time favorite as we got to build a spell checker. I have always noticed how my devices would autocorrect or give spelling corrections, but I always wanted to know how, and this lab did that. This was also the first time I got to work with reading files and comparing words.
